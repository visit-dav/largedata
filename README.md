## Welcome to the VisIt Large Data Repo

This is where the VisIt project hosts large datasets used in examples, tutorials
and other purposes. These datasets are managed using GitHub's Large File Support (LFS).

To facilitate HTTPs access to datasets hosted here, this respository is also generated
as a website and hosted at https://visit-dav.github.io/largedata/.
