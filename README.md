## Welcome to VisIt Large File Shares

This [website](https://visit-dav.github.io/largedata/) and the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/visit-dav/largedata/) that backs it up
is where the VisIt project hosts large, shared files and datasets used in
examples, tutorials and other purposes. These files are managed using
[GitHub's Large File Support (LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com) but are also
available to download individually via HTTPs. In addition, this
[repo](https://github.com/visit-dav/largedata/) can be used to
[share/upload](help/using-for-uploads.md) large files to VisIt developers.
For help using this site or repo, see [these notes](help/help.md).
