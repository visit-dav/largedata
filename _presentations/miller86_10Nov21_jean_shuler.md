These are the slides used for an [HPC Webinar](https://www.exascaleproject.org/event/55plus-years-in-hpc/) in conversation with Jean Shuler and her 55+ years of experience in HPC.

We will have a Q&A session with Jean Shuler, a woman who has worked at the leading edge of High-Performance Computing for more than 55 years.
Jean graduated with a degree in Mathematics from William and Mary in 1963 and taught herself programming on the job at NASA Langley.
By 1972, she came to LLNL where she has worked ever since.
She initially worked on early data storage and graphics systems.
Challenges in learning to use computing center resources gave Jean a passion for helping others find their way in HPC.
She eventually led User Services for the National Energy Research Scientific Computing (NERSC) Center.
This role took Jean all over the world contributing to Cray User Group meetings.
When NERSC moved from LLNL in 1996, Jean created and led the User Services Group for Livermore Computing.
Throughout her career, Jean has supported various HPC systems from CDC, Cray, Meiko, and IBM on the march to Exascale.
If you have an interest in computing history, the experiences and impact of women in computing or if you are early in your career and looking for some inspiration, you will want to attend this webinar and listen to Jean’s amazing career and stories.
