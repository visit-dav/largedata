These are the slides presented by
[Mark C. Miller](https://github.com/markcmiller86) for a talk titled

> When 100 Flops/Watt was a Giant Leap: The Inspiring History of the Apollo Guidance Computer
 
Abstract: This talk chronicles the development of the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC),
the ancestor of home computing technology leading to Apple and IBM PCs in the 1970s and
paving the way for handheld devices we all use today.  Although this work took place more
than 50 years ago, there are many stunning commonalities with current state of the art
such as flops/watt power constraints, fault tolerance, domain specific languages,
performance portability and more. This revolutionary computer made autonomous travel to
the Moon not only possible but added profoundly to crew safety, flight profile accuracy
and mission flexibility. The talk will give an overview of the AGC hardware architecture,
the guidance software it executed as well as the pioneering efforts in developing both.
In addition, we'll discuss and compare to the present day some of the historical social
context of the 1960's era in which this work took place. Time permitting, the talk will
conclude with several stories about actual user experiences with the AGC in Apollo missions.
