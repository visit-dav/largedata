## Help with 7-zip

7-zip is typically higher compression of binary data than other formats by
sometimes a factor of 2 or 3. But, because 7-zip decompression tools are
not always pre-built on various systems, users can wind up having to download
and install 7-zip tools in order to decompress `.7z` files.

Here are some options for *pre-compiled binary* installation of 7-zip tools...
