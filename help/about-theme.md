## How This Site Uses Jekyll

This repo is using GitHub's *builtin* [minimal](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/)
gh-pages theme. Because it is a GitHub *builtin* theme, its structure is *hugely* simplified
compared to an ordinary, custom [*Jekyll*](https://jekyllrb.com) theme based site.
Nonetheless, this site still uses some portions of a standard, custom *Jekyll* site
including the use of Liquid templating language in some files, the use of Jekyll
*collections* for the `datarchive` collection and the use of a *layout* specifically for
pages of the `datarchive` collection.
